# Next Steps: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION üö¢

This project is an interactive **machine learning web app** built with **Streamlit**, where users can predict the survival chances of Titanic passengers.  
It combines **two models** (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) and allows switching between them in real time.

## üîç Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to predict survival based on passenger details such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Class
- Fare
- Family size
- Embarkation port

This app lets users input passenger details and see predictions instantly.

##  Features
- Select between **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models  
- Interactive user inputs for all passenger features  
- On-the-fly prediction of survival outcome  
- Simple and clean UI powered by Streamlit
